# Demo: fresh clone to a rendered leaderboard

Every command below was run to produce this file. It takes a few minutes and needs
Python 3.11+ and Node 20+. No credentials are required. The controls are deterministic.

## 1. Install the CLI

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## 2. Confirm the packs are valid

```bash
arena validate benchmark_sets/v1
arena validate benchmark_sets/audit_v1
```

Both print `Valid benchmark set` and exit 0.

## 3. Generate run evidence

`--allow-local-execution` runs the fixture-owned tests in copied workspaces; it is off
by default. These controls are deterministic, so the scores are reproducible.

```bash
arena run benchmark_sets/audit_v1 --reviewer reference-patch     --mode full --allow-local-execution
arena run benchmark_sets/audit_v1 --reviewer control:perfect_patch  --mode full --allow-local-execution
arena run benchmark_sets/audit_v1 --reviewer control:keyword_gamer  --mode full --allow-local-execution
arena run benchmark_sets/audit_v1 --reviewer control:bad_patch      --mode full --allow-local-execution
arena run benchmark_sets/audit_v1 --reviewer control:malformed_patch --mode full --allow-local-execution
```

Rank them, and emit JSON for scripting. These runs used local execution, so they
are trusted-local (unverified); `--include-unverified` shows them on the leaderboard
(Docker-backed runs appear without it):

```bash
arena leaderboard runs/ --metric validated_case_rate --beta 1.0 --include-unverified
arena leaderboard runs/ --metric validated_case_rate --include-unverified --json
```

`reference-patch` and `control:perfect_patch` reach `validated_case_rate=1.000`;
`control:keyword_gamer` shows `detection_f_beta=1.000` with `validated_case_rate=0.000`.

## 4. Build the report snapshot the dashboard reads

```bash
arena audit-report runs/ --output docs/reports/audit-v1-results.md
```

This writes `dashboard/public/reports/audit-v1.json` (versioned and validated on write).
Optionally refresh the project-health snapshot:

```bash
python scripts/generate_verification_snapshot.py \
  --run-validation --run-quality-checks --generate-report
```

## 5. Run the API and dashboard

In one terminal:

```bash
arena serve
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000/leaderboard>. The leaderboard ranks the runs you just
generated; `/cases` browses both packs, `/runs/<id>` shows a full trace, and
`/reports/audit-v1` renders the report snapshot. If the API is not running, the home
and leaderboard pages fall back to the committed report snapshot, while `/cases` and
`/runs` explain that they need `arena serve`.

## Docker alternative

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Serves the API on `:8000` and the dashboard on `:3000`; the dashboard waits for the
API health check before starting.
