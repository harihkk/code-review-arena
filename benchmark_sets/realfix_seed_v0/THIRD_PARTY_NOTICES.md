# Third-party notices — RealFix Seed v0

This benchmark pack vendors source and test files from third-party open-source
projects so that each case is a complete, runnable reverse-review snapshot. The
redistributed files are reproduced under the upstream licenses in effect at the
pinned commits below. The full upstream license text for each project is included
in `licenses/`. This document preserves the notices accompanying the redistributed
files; it is a redistribution record, not legal advice.

Each case vendors the selected source tree at the **buggy** commit (as `after/`)
and at the **fixed** commit (as `before/`), and the selected test tree at the
fixed commit (as `tests/`). The exact selectors and changed paths for each case
are recorded in `benchmark_sources/realfix_seed_v0/<case-id>/evidence.yaml`.
