## About

Code Review Arena measures whether an AI review agent can find a seeded bug in a pull
request and actually fix it. It applies each suggested patch in an isolated workspace,
runs the required tests and validators, and scores detection separately from validation,
so a sharp-looking comment is never mistaken for a working repair. Everything runs
locally and the harness is model-agnostic.

## How it works

Each case is a seeded pull request with one or more known bugs, the files a fix should
touch, and the checks a fix must pass. The reviewer payload is blind: case id, stack,
the diff, and a bounded set of relevant files, with no title, description, category,
severity, or any ground truth (`--reveal-metadata` exists for debugging only). The
reviewer returns its findings and an optional patch, and the harness takes it from
there:

```
diff + files  ->  reviewer  ->  patch  ->  apply in workspace  ->  tests  ->  validators  ->  score
```

Every run produces two numbers:

| Metric | What it measures |
|---|---|
| `detection_f_beta` | The reviewer found the seeded bugs (file granularity; line precision is reported separately as `localization_rate`) |
| `validated_case_rate` | Its patch applied, passed the required tests, and satisfied the validators (the primary full-mode metric) |

The gap between them is the whole point. On `audit_v1` the `control:keyword_gamer`
control detects all ten bugs (`detection_f_beta=1.000`) yet validates none of its
patches (`validated_case_rate=0.000`), while `reference-patch` validates all ten.
`arena audit-report` and the dashboard show that gap per reviewer.

Signals are labeled by their strength: test execution and patch application are
execution-backed evidence; structural validators and concept matching are deterministic
heuristics (comment-stripped lexical and AST checks, not semantic understanding) and are
documented as such.

## Integrity and security model

The harness assumes reviewers and benchmark packs may be adversarial:

- Patches cannot touch the case's tests, any `conftest.py`/pytest config, or per-case
  `protected_paths`; absolute or `..` diff paths are rejected before `git apply` runs.
- Fixture test commands run with an allowlisted environment (no inherited shell
  secrets; `ARENA_PASSTHROUGH_ENV` forwards named variables explicitly) and POSIX
  resource limits (CPU, file size, open files, processes).
- `arena pack-hash --write` pins a pack's content checksum; runs record it and warn on
  mismatch. `arena lint-cases` flags ground-truth vocabulary leaking into the diff,
  comments, or test names.
- Every run writes `run_manifest.json` (harness version, git SHA, pack checksum,
  sanitized reviewer config, budgets, timings) so published numbers are auditable.
- The API server executes runs as bounded background jobs; local execution over HTTP
  requires a server-side opt-in, and `ARENA_API_TOKEN` adds token auth. It is not
  hardened for public exposure.

## Quickstart

Python 3.11 or newer is required.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

arena validate benchmark_sets/audit_v1
arena run benchmark_sets/audit_v1 --reviewer reference-patch --mode full --allow-local-execution
arena leaderboard runs/ --metric validated_case_rate --beta 1.0 --include-unverified
```

Two patch-backed packs ship today: `benchmark_sets/audit_v1` (domain-shaped review
failures) and `benchmark_sets/audit_v2` (a second batch of certified logic-defect cases).
Swap either path into the commands above.

`--allow-local-execution` opts into the fixture-owned test commands that run in copied
workspaces. Use it only with fixtures you trust. Runs that execute this way are marked
trusted-local and are excluded from the leaderboard unless you pass `--include-unverified`.

### Docker backend (the verified path)

Docker is the standard, isolation-backed way to run case tests. Build the sandbox image
once (it holds only Python and the packs' pinned test dependencies, no arena source):

```bash
bash scripts/build_bench_image.sh        # builds the arena-bench:1 image
```

Point a pack at it with `default_docker_image: arena-bench:1` in its `manifest.yaml`, or
set `docker_image` on a case. The executor never pulls a missing image (the name comes
from the pack), so the image must be built first; otherwise execution-backed runs cleanly
skip and report `invalid`. Docker-backed runs are leaderboard-eligible without
`--include-unverified`.

## Benchmark your own model

The built-in reviewers are the deterministic controls and `reference-patch`. To score a
real model, wrap it in any local command that reads the case JSON and prints review JSON,
then point `custom-command` at it. The payload is blind (no ground truth and no
descriptive metadata), so a reviewer cannot pass on metadata alone.

```bash
arena schema                       # the JSON contract your wrapper must emit
arena verify-reviewer benchmark_sets/audit_v1 \
  --command "python scripts/fake_reviewer.py --case {case_json}"   # one-case dry run

arena run benchmark_sets/audit_v1 \
  --reviewer custom-command \
  --command "python scripts/fake_reviewer.py --case {case_json}" \
  --mode full \
  --allow-local-execution
```

`scripts/fake_reviewer.py` is a working example to copy. The placeholders `{case_json}`,
`{diff_file}`, `{case_id}`, and `{workspace}` are expanded per case. `--max-wall-seconds`
and `--max-cost` cap a run; `--enable-repair` opts into a deterministic salvage of
almost-valid JSON (logged on the response).

## Reports and dashboard

```bash
arena audit-report runs/ --output docs/reports/audit-v1-results.md   # build the report from saved runs

arena serve            # local API
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev            # dashboard at http://localhost:3000
```

Main dashboard routes are `/leaderboard`, `/reports/audit-v1`, `/cases`, `/methodology`,
and `/docs`. For a full walk-through from a fresh clone, see [docs/DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md).

## Reference

Benchmark packs:

| Pack | Cases | Purpose | Validation |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `benchmark_sets/v1` | 10 | Baseline harness cases | review scoring + validation |
| `benchmark_sets/audit_v1` | 10 | Patch-required audit cases | patch apply + tests + validators |

Metrics:

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `validated_case_rate` | Primary full-mode score: validated cases over eligible cases |
| `detection_f_beta` | Found and localized seeded bugs |
| `patch_apply_rate` | Required patches that applied cleanly |
| `test_pass_rate` | Required regression-test runs that passed |
| `structural_pass_rate` | Required structural validator checks that passed |
| `false_positives_per_case` | Unsupported findings per evaluated case |

Control reviewers (deterministic harness checks, not external model results):

| Reviewer | Role |
|---|---|
| `reference-patch` | Loads committed known-good `reference.patch` artifacts |
| `control:perfect_patch` | Harness success control |
| `control:keyword_gamer` | Detection-only adversarial control |
| `control:bad_patch` | Detects bugs but supplies failing fixes |
| `control:detects_no_patch` | Detects bugs without a patch |
| `control:malformed_patch` | Supplies invalid patch output |
| `custom-command` | Runs your local reviewer command over structured input and output |

`mock:<mode>` remains a deprecated alias for `control:<mode>` for one release.

Audit Pack v1 cases:

| Category | Seeded bug |
|---|---|
| Security | FastAPI tenant admin bypass |
| Security | SQL ownership leak |
| Security | JWT audience and issuer validation |
| Distributed systems | Kafka duplicate event |
| Distributed systems | Out-of-order event |
| RAG safety | Fabricated citation |
| RAG safety | Prompt injection policy override |
| Concurrency | Async race |
| Reliability | Idempotency tenant scope |
| API correctness | Pagination cursor bug |

## Development

```bash
make check                      # full gate: lint, typecheck, tests, pack validation, contamination
cd dashboard && npm run build   # dashboard build gate
```

See [docs/](docs/README.md) for architecture, metrics, the reviewer interface, case
authoring, and the audit report.

## Limitations

- The packs are curated and small (30 cases across `v1`, `audit_v1`, and `audit_v2`).
- Concept matching is lexical (curated keywords), not semantic; well-paraphrased
  findings can be under-credited. Execution metrics do not have this problem.
- Structural validators are comment-stripped heuristics: hand-authored, may reject
  alternate valid repairs, and string literals are not stripped. Tests are the gate.
- Passing tests is execution evidence, not proof of complete correctness.
- This is a local audit harness, not a large-scale public ranking.
