"""Pack certification: is a benchmark case a real test of repair?

Each executable case is graded on a four-rung ladder:

- ``draft``: no executable tests. Useful for detection scoring only; it cannot
  be backed by execution, so it can never rise above this rung.
- ``development``: has tests but fails a gate below.
- ``certified``: the buggy baseline (after/) FAILS the tests, the reference
  solution (after/ + reference.patch) PASSES them, and mutants of the solution
  are killed at or above ``CERTIFIED_KILL_RATE`` (see arena.benchmark.mutation).
- ``verified``: certified, and the baseline-fails / reference-passes verdicts
  held across repeated runs (the determinism gate). A flaky case whose verdict
  wobbles between runs cannot be trusted to score a repair, so it stays at
  ``certified`` no matter how good its single-run gates look.

The determinism gate is opt-in (``determinism_runs >= 2``) because it re-runs
the suite; without it a case tops out at ``certified``.
