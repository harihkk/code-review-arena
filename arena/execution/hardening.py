"""Reduced-privilege environment and resource limits for fixture commands.

Benchmark fixtures are untrusted: packs can come from third parties, and the
test commands they declare run on the host (when trusted-local execution is
allowed). Three mitigations apply to every locally executed fixture command:

- the child environment is built from an allowlist instead of inheriting the
  parent environment, so shell secrets and API keys are never exposed;
- HOME and TMPDIR point at a fresh, empty, per-run temporary directory, so a
  fixture cannot read ~/.ssh, ~/.aws, ~/.config, or the host temp space;
- POSIX resource limits bound CPU time, file size, open files, and process
  count so a runaway or malicious fixture cannot exhaust the host.

None of this replaces real isolation (containers): it is containment, not a
security boundary. Use the Docker backend for untrusted packs.
