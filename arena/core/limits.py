"""Centralized, documented size and count limits for external input.

These are OPERATIONAL SAFETY bounds (denial-of-service and memory protection),
not claims about semantic correctness. They are chosen with generous headroom
over the maxima observed across the shipped packs, control-reviewer outputs, and
run fixtures, but are deliberately finite so an adversarial pack, reviewer, or API
client cannot drive the harness into pathological memory or compute. External
input that exceeds a bound is REJECTED with a located validation error, never
silently truncated (the one exception is the reviewer source context, whose
truncation is an explicit, recorded part of that contract).

Observed maxima at the time of writing (benchmark_sets/v1, audit_v1, audit_v2):
manifest 451 B, case.yaml 1291 B, pr.diff 1071 B, reference.patch 1021 B,
10 cases/manifest, 1 bug/case, 1 file/bug, 1 line-range/file, 4 concepts,
5 fix keywords, 4 stack entries, title 75, description 201, category 19,
case id 45, concept 26, test_command string 15, YAML depth 9, YAML nodes 104,
test timeout 30 s, beta 1.0, score weights summing to 100, penalties 5/15/20.
Limits below sit well above these.

Scope: these bound individual input byte sizes and (after the YAML structure caps
below) parsed YAML structure. They do NOT bound total filesystem entry count or
provide immutable traversal, name-collision handling, or time-of-check/time-of-use
protection for pack trees; that comprehensive enforcement remains Phase 1C. So
these limits reduce, but do not by themselves eliminate, every adversarial pack's
ability to cause pathological memory or compute.
